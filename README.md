# 📡 Arduino Radar System (Ultrasonic + Servo)

## 🔎 Objective
Designed and implemented a **mini radar system** using Arduino Uno, an Ultrasonic sensor, and a Servo motor.  
The system scans an area, detects objects, measures their distance, and visualizes the data on a simple radar-like interface.

## ⚡ Features
- 2D scanning using Servo rotation (0° to 180°).
- Distance measurement using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
- Real-time obstacle detection.
- Serial output for data visualization (compatible with Processing IDE).
- Low-cost radar prototype for learning IoT & embedded systems.
